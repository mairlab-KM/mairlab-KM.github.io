We study intelligence that enables robots to understand the world and act autonomously by leveraging _auditory_ and _other multimodal information_.

Especially our research interests are as follows:
- **Robot Audition** that can operate in real-world complex environments.
- **Sound-Aware Multimodal LLM** capable of understanding and reasoning about the world by leveraging auditory and other modalities.
- **Sound-based Embodied AI** that can act based on its understanding and reasoning about the world.

We are actively recruiting motivated graduate and undergraduate students!
