# Speech and Audio Recognition (2025 Fall)

## Course Information

- **Semester**: Fall 2025
- **Instructor**: Prof. Inkyu An
- **Department**: School of Computer Science, Kookmin University

## Course Description

This course covers fundamental concepts and state-of-the-art techniques in speech and audio processing, with emphasis on modern deep learning approaches. Students will learn digital signal processing, classical and modern speech recognition methods, audio source separation, and cutting-edge technologies including self-supervised learning, multi-channel processing, and diffusion-based text-to-speech synthesis. The course bridges theoretical foundations with practical applications in robot audition and audio-visual systems.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Digital signal processing techniques for audio analysis
- Apply speech and audio recognition technologies
