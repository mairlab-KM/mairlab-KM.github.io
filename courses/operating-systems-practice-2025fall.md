# Operating Systems Practice (2025 Fall)

## Course Information

- **Semester**: Fall 2025
- **Instructor**: Prof. Inkyu An
- **Department**: School of Computer Science, Kookmin University

## Course Description

This course provides hands-on experience with robotic operating systems through practical implementation using ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2). Students will learn to develop robotic applications, work with sensors, implement SLAM and path planning algorithms, and gain practical experience with both simulated and real robots. The course emphasizes practical robotics programming and system integration.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Set up and configure ROS2 development environments
- Design and implement ROS2 nodes and communication systems
- Work with robotic sensors including LiDAR and depth cameras
- Program real robots using ROS2 frameworks
